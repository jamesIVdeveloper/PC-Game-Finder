This app is designed to help PC gamers find deals on PC games from multiple websites.  The user can type in a game title, and/or set their price range from lowest to highest, and the app will display PC games with their prices and a link to the website where they can buy it.  

To build this app, I used HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery
